    <p>So what is this book, Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid - usually known by its acronym, "GEB" - really all about?

    That question has hounded me ever since I was scribbling its first drafts in pen, way back in 1973. Friends would inquire, of course, what I was so gripped by, but I was hard pressed to explain it concisely. A few years later, in 1980, when GEB found itself for a while on the bestseller list of The New York Times, the obligatory one-sentence summary printed underneath the title said the following, for several weeks running: "A scientist argues that reality is a system of interconnected braids." After I protested vehemently about this utter hogwash, they finally substituted something a little better, just barely accurate enough to keep me from howling again.<p>

    <p>Many people think the title tells it all: a book about a mathematician, an artist, and a musician. But the most casual look will show that these three individuals per se, august though they undeniably are, play but tiny roles in the book's content. There's no way the book is about these three people!</p>

    <p>Well, then, how about describing GEB as "a book that shows how math, art, and music are really all the same thing at their core"? Again, this is a million miles off - and yet I've heard it over and over again, not only from nonreaders but also from readers, even very ardent readers, of the book.</p>

    <p>And in bookstores, I have run across GEB gracing the shelves of many diverse sections, including not only math, general science, philosophy, and cognitive science (which are all fine), but also religion, the occult, and God knows what else. Why is it so hard to figure out what this book is about? Certainly it's not just its length. No, it must be in part that GEB delves, and not just superficially, into so many motley topics - fugues and canons, logic and truth, geometry, recursion, syntactic structures, the nature of meaning, Zen Buddhism, paradoxes, brain and mind, reductionism and holism, ant colonies, concepts and mental representations, translation, computers and their languages, DNA, proteins, the genetic code, artificial intelligence, creativity, consciousness and free will  sometimes even art and music, of all things! - that many people find it impossible to locate the core focus.</p>
